# color_block_picker

###jQuery Color Block Picker
You will be creating a little 'pick the block' game with HTML, CSS, and jQuery!

On document load, append four (or more!) divs on to the DOM with jQuery, each colored with a different color. 
Each div needs to know which color it is.
Prompt the player to pick one of the color blocks you created at random.
